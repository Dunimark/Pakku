## About

With **Pakku**, you can create modpacks for **CurseForge**, **Modrinth** or **both simultaneously**.

It's a package manager that significantly simplifies Minecraft modpack development. Inspired by package managers like npm and Cargo.
Besides package management itself, it enables support for version control, simplifies collaboration options, and adds support for CI/CD.

## Features

### A Comprehensive Toolkit for Modpack Development

- **Project Operations**
  - `pakku add` - Add new projects with automatic dependency resolution
  - `pakku rm` - Remove projects safely with dependency checking
  - `pakku update` - Update projects individually or in bulk
  - `pakku ls` - List and inspect project details
  - `pakku diff` - Compare different versions of your modpack

- **Development Environment**
  - `pakku init` - Create new modpacks
  - `pakku import` - Import existing modpacks
  - `pakku fetch` - Set up or update your development environment
  - `pakku export` - Create distribution-ready packages

### Multiplatform :dna: 

Modpack development with the split of mod hosting platforms has become significantly harder. Pakku addresses this problem and tries to be as helpful as possible when developing a multiplatform modpack.

When adding a mod, resource pack or shader (further referred to as "Project") to your modpack, Pakku has a robust way to find it across both platforms. And even If this fails, you can specify the project slug, ID, or version manually.

### Optimized :abacus: 

Pakku is multithreaded to ensure everything is done as quickly as possible.

Pakku is also efficient with its HTTP requests, reducing them to a minimum. This ensures that data is sent quicker back to you and that you do not get rate-limited by adding or updating too many projects at once.

### Configurable :nut_and_bolt: 

Pakku utilises a design used by many well-known package managers like npm or Cargo, which consists of two files, the config file and the lock file.

This allows you to fine-tune your modpack, while still being up-to-date. If any data retrieved from the platforms does not suit your requirements, you can simply override it in the config file.

### Advanced Features ðŸŽ¯

- **Powerful Configuration Options**
  - Platform-specific support for `overrides`, `server-overrides` and `client-overrides`
  - Per-project support for configuring project side, update strategy, subpath, aliases and more

- **Platform Migration**
  - Convert between CurseForge and Modrinth formats
  - Create multiplatform modpacks from single-platform sources
  - Preserve project relationships during conversion

- **File Management**
  - `pakku sync` - Sync your local project files with your modpack
  - Glob pattern support for file matching
  - Automatic file syncing with the [project overrides directory](https://juraj-hrivnak.github.io/Pakku/pakku-directory.html#adding-project-overrides)

### Quality of Life Features ðŸ’¡

- **Development Assistance**
  - Automatic project-side and project-type detection
  - Partial redistribution permission checking

- **Integration**
  - File Director integration
