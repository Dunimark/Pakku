# About Pakku

Pakku is a multiplatform modpack manager for Minecraft: Java Edition.

With Pakku, you can create a modpack for CurseForge, Modrinth or both simultaneously.
To create a modpack you can either start from scratch or import an existing modpack.

Pakku includes many features to make your life easier as a modpack developer.

## Optimized

Pakku is multithreaded to ensure everything is done as quickly as possible.

Pakku also uses batched HTTP requests. This ensures that data is sent quicker back to you
and that you do not get rate-limited by adding or updating too many 
[projects] at once.

## Configurable

Pakku does not limit you to how many mod loaders or Minecraft versions you can use.
Any combination is possible, and you are only limited to the individual [project] requirements.

## Multiplatform

Pakku tries to be as helpful as possible when developing a multiplatform modpack.
With automating project searching based on slugs or manual prompt.
